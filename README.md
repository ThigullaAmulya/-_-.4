The provided Java code encompasses an online examination system that allows users to participate in an examination, submit their answers, and receive results. The program is structured into distinct classes: `User`, `Exam`, and `ExamSession`, as well as the main program logic within the `Main` class.

The `User` class is responsible for user-related functionalities. It stores user data such as username, password, and full name, and offers methods to authenticate the user's password, update their password and full name when desired.

The `Exam` class represents the examination content. It encapsulates arrays containing questions, options for each question, and the correct answers. This class provides methods to retrieve the question count, individual questions, options, and correct answers.

The `ExamSession` class manages the user's interaction with the examination. It tracks the user, the ongoing exam, selected answers, the current question, session time limits, and start time. This class includes methods to determine if the session is active, submit answers, retrieve and display questions and options, calculate elapsed time, and provide the user's full name.

The `Main` class serves as the entry point and orchestrator of the program. It initiates the exam by presenting the user with authentication, exam session, and result reporting. The program begins by presenting a sample user and exam data, prompting the user to log in. If the authentication is successful, the user proceeds to update their profile, start the exam session, and ultimately log out. The program also calculates the time taken for the user to complete the exam and displays the results.

Overall, this program showcases the effective use of object-oriented programming concepts in Java to create an interactive online examination system. It demonstrates the separation of concerns among classes, encapsulation of user data and exam content, dynamic interaction with the user, time tracking, and result presentation.
